Bugs going on with my program :

I think I finally realized why the graph and the table are off-sync with each other. The table is automatically
set to run as soon as the main interface window starts up, and when the user selects the currency to graph, the 
graph will appear, but only after the table has run for an arbitrary amount of time. 

Unknown Date Between July, 8th, and August 1st, 2017:

I managed to get the chart and table on sync, but now I have errors whenever I try to uncheck the sync
check-box within the settings tab of the visual interface. Whats happening is whenever the check-box is unchecked
within the program, its sends a call to my code telling it to cancel the chart

I don't think I fixed that weird bug where if we run the chart and graph for a certain amount of time, it will say
that a certain point is below or above of the mininmum or maximum. It usually happens after a long time however.
